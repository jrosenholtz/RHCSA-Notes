25.1 Understanding linux time

there are many different commands and clocks in linux

hardware clock -> System Clock

the system clock always gets its time from the hardware clock at boot. the command for this is hwclock. 

there is also a timedatectl command for the system clock. 

most linux systems are connected to NTP, or the network time protocol. This is a kind of server that provides time information

be aware, if you are off more than 1000sec, you will not be able to synchronize with NTP and you will have to set the hardware clock
