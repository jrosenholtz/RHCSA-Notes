26.1 configuring a basae nfs server

run the nfs-server service

create a directory to share:/data

edit /etc/exports to contain the following line
	/data *(rw,no_root_squash) - the star in this case indicates who can access the server, this is an IP or hostname, not users. rw is read-write, no_root_squash means root users from other computers retain root permissions in this share

configure the firewalld firewall:
	add nfs, mountd, and RPC-bind services.
