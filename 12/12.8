12.7 Managing Temporary Files

systemd-tmpfiles manages some temp files

/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d directory manages settings for creating, deleting and cleaning up of temp files

the systemd-tmpfiles-clean.timer unit can be configured to automatically clean up temporary files	
	it triggers the systemd-tmpfiles-clean.service
	this service run systemd-tmpfiles --clean
	
/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf file contains settings for automatic tmp file cleanup

when making mods, copy the file to /etc/tmpfiles.d

after making mods to this file, use systemd-tmpfiles --clean /etc/tmpfiles.d/tmp.conf

in tmp.conf youll find lines specifying which directory to monitor, which permissions are set, which owners, and how many days of not being used before you delete the file

different actions can be performed on the directories and files that are managed

consult man tmpfiles.d
