12.5 Scheduling with cron

use crontab -e as the user you want to run the job. in many cases this will be the root user

next you need a time specification. ex. */10 4 11 12 1-5
	minute (*/10)
	hour (4)
	day of month (11)
	month (12)
	day of week (1-5)
	this will run every 10 minutes at 4 am on the 11th day in december AND mon-friday
	
Cron does NOT have stdout. This means you have to put scripts to logs

you can use man 5 crontab to see the time and date fields. this is a useful manpage
