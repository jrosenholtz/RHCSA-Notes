12.1 Understanding cron and at

cron is a daemon that triggers jobs on a regular basis

it works with different configuration files that specify when a job should be started

use it for re occuring jobs, like backups

at is used for tasks that need to be started once

systemd timers provide a new alternative to cron. They aren't as precise as cron but still very useful.
