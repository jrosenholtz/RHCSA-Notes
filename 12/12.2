12.2 UNderstanding cron Scheduling operations

User specific ctron jobs, created using crontab -e

generic time specific cron jobs in /etc/cron.d

scripts, executed on an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly basis. These are in /etc/cron.hourly, etc/cron.daily, etc.

There are generic cron jobs in /etc/crontab, but this is deprecated

if you need a crontab for a specific user, use crontab -e. cron.d is usually used by rpms, so don't use this. things that need to be executed once an hour, week, or month, can be placed in the hourly or daily directories.
