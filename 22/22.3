22.3 Understanding SELinux context labels and booleans

every object is labeled with a context label. a context label is 3 parts
	user
	role
	type - flags which type of operation is allowed on this object. the type is the only part which matters for rhcsa. 

Many commands support a -Z option to show the current context information

context types are used in the rules in the policy to define which source object has access to which target object.

a boolean is an on/off switch

use it to enable or disable specific categories of functionality all together. 

getsebool -A - get selinux booleans

setsebool -P boolean on/off -  switch booleans for selinux
