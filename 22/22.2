22.2 managing SELinux modes

selinux can be enabled or disabled, this is all handled at the kernel level. If you want to switch between them, you MUST reboot. 

luckily there is a troubleshooting mode, so while enabled selinux can be enforcing or permissive.

in enforcing, selinux will act as normal

in permissive, selinux will not block anything but it will still log

use getenforce to get the current status

you can use the setenforce command to switch

setenforce permissive

setenforce enforcing

edit /etc/sysconfig/selinux to manage the default state of selinux

NEVER set to disabled if it is meant to be temporary!
