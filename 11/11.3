11.3 Modifying Systemd service configuration

you may have to modify service configuration as well

default system provided systemd unit files are in /usr/lib/systemd/system - dont touch these

custom files go in /etc/systemd/system.

run time generated files are in /run/systemd

while modifying a unit file, do NOT edit the file in /usr/lib/systemd/system but create a custom file in /etc/systemd/system that is used as an overlay file


better yet, use systemctl edit unit.service to edit unit files

use systemctl show to show available parameters

you may need to use systemctl-reload
