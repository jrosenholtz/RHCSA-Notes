20.1 Understanding ssh key-based login

ssh-keygen is the tool to generate keys for ssh login

there are 2 keys, private and public

the private key is like your identity, it needs to be protected, the public key on the other hand needs to be copied to your home directory on the server

ssh-copy-id will copy your public key to the location on the server

when you establish an ssh session, it sends back a packet encrpyted with your public key. if you can decrypt and respond with your private key, you are allowed to make a secure connection
