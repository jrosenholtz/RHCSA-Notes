20.2 setting up ssh key-based login

ssh-keygen creates a public/private keypair for the current user
	setting a passphrase will make it more secure but less convenient
	
ssh-copy-id will copy the public key to the target server

ssh-agent /bin/bash allocates space in the bash shell to cache the private key passphrase

ssh-add adds the current passphrase to the cache
