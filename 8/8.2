8.2 Understanding NIC naming	

an IP configuration needs to be connected to a specific network device

use ip link show to see current devices, use ip addr show to check configuration

every system has an IO device used for internal networking

apart from that you will see that name of the real network device, which is presented as a BIOS name

classical naming is using device names like eth0, eth1, and so on
	these dont reveal info about physical location
	
BIOS naming is based on hardware properties to give more specific information in the device name
	em[1-n] for embedded nic
	en[nn] for embedded nics
	p<slot>p<port> for nics on pci bus
	
if the driver doesn't reveal these properties, classiscal naming is used, but bios name is default
