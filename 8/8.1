8.1 Understanding IPv4 Networking

in ipv4, each node needs its own IP address, written in dotted decimal notation

each IP address must be indicated with the subnet mask behind it I.E 192.168.4.200/24

the default router specifies which server to forward packets to that have external destinations

dns nameserver is the ip of the server that provides dns

ipv4 is the most common ip version, but ipv6 can be used as well

ipv4 and ipv6 can exist on the same network interface

RHEL by default used ipv6

ALWAYS SPECIFY THE SUBNET MASK

always include subnet, gateway, and dns
