8.3 Managing runtime configuration with IP

Runtime configuration referes to configurations that are not persistent across reboots

the ip tool can manage all aspects of configuration. It replaces ifconfig. Do not use ifconfig

use ip addr to manage address properties

use ip link to show link properties

ip route manages route properties

ip link show - see info about links

ip -s link show - shows statistics about packets recieved, dropped, and transmitted. This can be useful

ip addr show to see current address configuration

ip addr add dev ens33 10.0.0.10/24 -  example of how to add an ip address. This would be a second ip address

these configurations are runtime, meaning they will not persist through reboots.

ip route show - this shows the current routing table

DNS is managed through a configuration file. You cannot easily do this on a command line, but you can change etc/resolv.conf. THIS IS A RUNTIME FILE. it will not persist
you will need to use network manager to get it persistent.
