13.3 Working with systemd-journald

systemd-journald is the log service that is a part of systemd-journald

it integrates well with systemctl status <unit> output

this can be a very useful feature of systemd-journald

journalctl command can also be used to read log entries

messages are also logged to rsyslogd, using the rsyslogd imjournal module

the journal is not persistent. to make it persistent, use mkdir /var/log/journal.

you can use the configuration file /etc/systemd/journald.conf to adjust retention and other parameters for journald logging.
