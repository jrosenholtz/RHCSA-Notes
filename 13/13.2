13.2 Configuring Rsyslog Logging

rsyslog is both a legacy service and not. it is no longer used in a primary capacity, but is still used to write journalctl logs to /var/logs

rsyslog needs the rsyslogd service to be running

the main configuration file is /etc/rsyslog.conf

snap in files can be placed in /etc/rsyslog.d. This is commonly used by rpm packages

each logger line contains three items - these are the most important configuration items
	facility: the specific facility the log was created for
	severity: the severity from which should be logged
	destination: the file or other destination the log should write to. 
	
log files are typically in /var/logs

use the logger command to write messages to rsyslog manually. The logger command is a nice command, you can write anything to syslog so you know whats going on. 

rsyslogd is and must be backwards compatible with the archaic syslog service that was invented in the 80'service

in syslog, a fixed number of facilities was defined, like kern, authpriv, cron, and more. 

to work with services that dont have their own facility, local {0..7} can be used. 

because of the lack of facilities, some services take care of their own logging and dont use rsyslog. This can sometimes be a problem because it makes it more difficult to create a centralized log server

Rules are the most important thing in /etc/rsyslog.conf.
