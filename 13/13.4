13.4 Configuring Logging

the journal is written to /run/log/journal, which is cleared on reboot

edit /etc/systemd/journald.conf to make the journal persistent across reboots

set the storage parameter in this file to the appropriate value
	persistent will store the journal in the /var/log/journal directory. This directory will be created if it doesn't exist
	Volatile stores the journal only in /run/log/journal
	auto will store the journal in /var/log/journal if that directory exists, and in /run/log/journal if no /var/log/journal exists.
	
There is a built in log rotation for the journal as well

the rotation runs monthly

the journal cannot grow beyond 10% of the size of the file system it is on

the journal will also make sure at least 15% of its file system will remain available as free space

these settings can be changed in /etc/systed/journald.conf
