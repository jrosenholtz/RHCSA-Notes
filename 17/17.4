17.4 Managing systemd targets

a systemd target is a group of unit files

some targets are isolatable, whioch means they define the final state a system is starting in
	emergency.target - this is a minimal target, designed to run with the least possible amount of services
	rescue.target - this is also a troubleshooting target, but it loads a few more services. 
	multi-user.target - this is the state most servers boot into. all services are running, but there is no graphical interface
	graphical.target - all services are running, and there is graphical interaction with the os
	
When enabling a unit, it is added to a specific target. 

you can see what services are in which targets under /etc/systemd/system/*.target.wants

you can see specific service targets using systemctl cat service and checking the [install] entry

if you enable a service, the symbolic link is created under the /etc/systemd/system/*.target.wants directory

there are also non isolatable targets, such as getty.target and nfs-client.target. These have dependencies but are not a final boot state

use systemctl list-dependencies to view these targets
