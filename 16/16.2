16.2 Working with kernel Modules

Linux Drivers are implemented as kernel modules
	if you want to work with something, you need the appropriate modules

most kernel modules are loaded automatically with initramfs or systemd-udevd

use modprobe to manually load kernel modules

use lsmod to list current kernel modules

use modprobe -r to unload a module

there is not much to worry about with this for the rhcsa, most of the time they are loaded automatically.
