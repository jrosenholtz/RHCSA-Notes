16.4 using /proc to tune kernel behavior

/proc is a file system that provides access to kernel information
	PID directories - information about running processes
	status files - information about what is happening on your system
	tunables in /proc/sys - change kernels behavior in real time
	
use echo to write a value to any file in /proc/sys to change kernel performance parameters

write the parameters to /etc/sysctl.conf to make them persistent

use sysctl -a to show current settings

in /etc/sysctl.conf you must add the performance parameters you want changed in the following format:

net.ipv4.forward = 0
