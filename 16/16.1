16.1 Understanding the linux kernel

the linux kernel is the heart of the linux operating system

the linux kernel addresses hardware devices

the linux kernel has drivers to interface with hardware. in the linux kernel, these are called modules

There are some important modules in the kernel:

initramfs
	this module is loaded when linux boots
	there are a lot of modules compiled into initramfs when you install your system
systemd-udevd
	systemd-udevd recognizes hot plug hardware, one example is a usb thumb drivers

modprobe
	the modprobe command is a good way to work with drivers. you can use this command to manually load drivers.
	

to access the kernel, you use the userspace shell. By typing a command, a system call is made to the kernel. Based on the syscall, the kernel knows what to do. Every syscall is going to interact with a module in some way.
