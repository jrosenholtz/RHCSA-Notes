27.5 Attaching storage to containers

container storage is ephemeral

modifications are written to the container writable layer and stay for the container lifetime. 

persistent storage will keep files externally

us bind mounts to connect a directory inside the container to directory on the host

ensure the user account used in the container has access to the host directory, and set the selinux context type to container_tile_t

if the container user is the owner of the host directory, the :Z option can be used: podman run -d v /webfiles:/webfiles:Z nginx

using SELinux is essential, or root containers would have full access to the host system

sudo mkdir /dbfiles

sudo chmod o+w /dbfiles

sudo semanage fcontext -a -t container_file_t "/dbfiles(/.*)?"

you MUST BE THE OWNER of the file if you are trying to mount a directory like this
