27.3 managing images

the image is a read only runnable instance of the container

images are obtained from registries, which are specified in /etc/contianters/registries.conf

additional registries can be added in the [registries.search] section of this file

use podman info to see which registries are being used

insecure registries are not protected with tls encrpytion and must be listed in [registries.insecure]

podman search searches all registries

use filters to further limit the resulk
	--limit 5 shows a maximum of 5 images per registry
	--filter stars=5 shows images with 5 stars or more
	--filter is-official=true shows official images only
	
websearch is availabe through https://access.redhat.com/containers

use skopeo to inspect images before pulling them

skopeo inspect docker://registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi8
use podman to inspect images that are locally available
	podman images
	podman inspect image name
	
some docker images are designed to run as root. They wont run in podman without sudo

use complete urls where possible

when newer versions of images are available, old versions are still kept

use podman images to list images

podman rmi to remove
