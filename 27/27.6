27.6 Managing containers as a service

to automatically start containers ins a standalone situation, you can create systemd user unit files for rootless containers and manage them with systemctl

if k8 or openshift is used, containers will be started by default

systemd user services start when a user session is opened and close when a user session is stopped

use loginctl enable-linger to change that behavior and start user services for a specific user (req root)

	loginctl enable-linger linda
	loginctl show-user linda

create a user account to manage containers

use podman to generate a user systemd file for a containers

this file will be generate in the current directory
	podman generate systemd --name myweb --files

to have systemd create the container when the service starts and delete it again when the service stops, add --new
	podman generate systemd --name ephemeral_ellie --files --new

to generate a service file for a root container, do it from the /etc/systemd/system as the directory

user specific files should go in ~/.config/systemd/user

manage them with systemctl --user	
	systemctl --user daemon-reload
	systemctl --user enable myapp.service
	systemctl --user start myapp.service
	
systemctl only workin on console or ssh and not in su
