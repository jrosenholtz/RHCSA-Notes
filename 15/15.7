mkfs is the MaKe File System utility

mkfs.ext4 creates and Ext4 file system

use mkfs.[tab][tab] to show a list of available file system

do NOT use mkfs alone as it will create an EXT2 filey system

after making the file system, mount it in runtime using the mount command

use umount for unmounting a device.

/mnt/ is used for temporary or runtime mounts

if a drive is busy, use lsof to list open files
