9.8 Managing Priorities and Niceness

By Default, linux priorities start with the same priority

in kernel land realtime processes are handled with the highest priorty

to change priorities of non realtime processes, the nice and renice commands can be used

nice values range from -20 to 19. higher is "nicer" and use less cpu cycles

negatice nice values increase priority, positive decrease priority

users can set their processes to a lower priority, but cannot increase it without root

the highest priority is RT or real time, it goes before any other processes and is typically reserved for important kernel processes

nice will set the niceness of a new process, renice will set the niceness of a running process
