9.1 Understanding jobs and Processes

all tasks are started as processes, whether a webserver or command

all processes have a PID, this is a process identification number

common process management include scheduling priority and sending signals

some processes are starting multiple threads, individual threads cannot be managed. Multi-threaded processes are managed as one process. Most processes are one thread only though

tasks that are managed from the shell can be managed as a job. These can be run in the foreground or background
