10.2 Setting up Repo access

We will create a local repo to install packages from the RHEL 8 installation disk ISO image. You can also set up repos from https or ftp

Create an ISO: dd if=/dev/sr0 of=/RHEL9.iso bs=1m - bs=1M makes it work with 1 MB blocks

Create a directory /repo: mkdir /repo

add this line to fstab to autmount this dir: /RHEL9.iso /repo iso9660 defaults 0 0 

Next, create the file /etc/yum.repos.d/appstream.repo with the following contents
	[appstream] - this the label, always between square brackets
	name=appstream - this is the name of the repo
	baseurl=file:///repo/AppStream - this is the location of the repo. This always starts with a uri, in this case that is file://
	gpgcheck=0
	
dont worry about gpgcheck if you are using a local repo

each repo needs its own entry, so we still need a repo for the base apps repo located under /repo/BaseOS. Create in the file /etc/yum.repos.d/base.repo

[base]
name=base
baseurl=file:///repo/BaseOS
gpgcheck=0
