10.8 using RPM queries

for most software management you use yum, but you can use rpm sometimes

rpm is the legacy command, but its not good at dependency management

rpm is still useful for package queries

rpm queries are by default agains the database of installed packages, add -p to query package files
	rpm -qf /any/file
	rpm -ql mypackage
	rpm -qc mypackage
	rpm -qp --scripts mypackage-file.rpm

use rpm -qf on configuration files to find what package it is associated with

use rpm -ql to find out about packages

use -qc on a package to find config files

use -qd on a file to find documentation such as man pages

use -qp to query a local package file instead of a package from the database. adding --scripts will allow you to inspect the scripts included and audit them to make sure there is nothing fishy going on.
