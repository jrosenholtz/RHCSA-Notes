10.3 Understanding Modules and Application Streams

RHEL 8 introduced application streams and modules

app streams can be used to seperate user space packages from core kernel operations

using application streams allow for working with different versions of packages

base packages are provided through the baseOS repo

appstream is a seperate repo


appstreams are delivered in 2 formats
	traditional rpms
	new modules

Modules can contain streams to make multiple versions of apps available

enabling a module stream gives access to rpm packages in that stream

modules can also have profiles. A profile is a list of packages that belong to a specific use case
	example: minimal, complete, recommended installations, etc

the package list of a module can contain packages outside the module stream

use the yum module command to manage modules
