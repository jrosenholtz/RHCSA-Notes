18.3 troubleshooting filesystem issues

sometimes fs corruption occurs, but rarely and usually it is automatically fixed

the most common problems come from typos in /etc/fstab

if necessary, remount the files in an rw state and edit /etc/fstab

use mount -a to check your fstab before you create a problem 

make sure you reboot after each adjustment to make sure its working

gfragmentation can be an issue, different tools exist to fix it
	xfs_fsr is the xfs file system reorganizer and can optimize xfs fs
	e4defrag can be used to defrag ext4
