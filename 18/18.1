18.1 Understanding Troubleshooting modes

if you are having trouble booting, there are various places you can stop the system for troubleshooting

Post - boot cd
Uefi/Bios
grub2 - kernel arguments only, such as rhgb, quiet, and target modes
kernel
initramfs - rd.break. This will allows you to get into the system before systemd
systemd - init=/bin/bash. this removes systemd and replaces the init with /bin/bash
os - systemd.unit=emergency.target. this gives you the emergency mode if the problem arises early in the boot procedure
services - rescue.target


if you cannot even load the kernel, you must use the grub menu

if your kernel is loading, use rd.break. you can simply append this to the end of the linux line from the grub boot menu

if something goes wrong with loading systemd units, you will either use emergency.target or rescue.target depending on where the issue is.
