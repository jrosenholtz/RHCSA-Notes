enter grub menu

find the line that loads the linux kernel and add rd.break to the end of the line

mount -o remount,rw /sysroot - mount sysroot as read and writable - this command allows you to pass different mount commands to a mounted drive without having to mount it again

chroot /sysroot - /sysroot is the location of the real root system. chroot changes the location of the root directory

echo secret | passwd --stdin root - change the root user account password

ctrl+d 

ctrl+d

once you do this, you will see that selinux needs to complete its autorelable. Make sure you let this complete, or the system will bork
