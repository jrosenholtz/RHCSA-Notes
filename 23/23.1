23.1 Understanding RHEL firewall configuration

firewalling starts at the kernel, because the kernel inspects all packets from the NIC

the kernel uses netfilter. Netfilter is an integrated part of the linux kernel

there is an interface on top of the kernel called nftables to tell netfilter what to block and allow

nftables is low level. it has commands to interact with it, but they are difficult to use

there is now firewalld, to write nftables rules easily.
