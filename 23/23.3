23.3 configuring a firewall with firewall-cmd

the firewall-cmd command is used to write firewall configurations

use --permanent to write a persistent config, but this wont write to runtime

without --permanent, the rule is runtime but not persistent.

firewall-cmd --get-services to get a list of available services

used --add-service ftp to add ftp service to add a service to the configurations
