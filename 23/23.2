23.2 Understanding firewalld components

firewalld is using different components to make firewalling easier

service: the main component, it tells the ports and kernel modules to load

zone: a default config to which network cardscan be assigned to apply specific settings

ports: elements to allow access to specific ports

additional components are available, but not usually used in a base configuration.
