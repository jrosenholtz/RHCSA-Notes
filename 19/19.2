19.2 essential shell script commands

scripts must be executable, use chmod +x myscript

if you are trying to run a script, and you don't want it to point to it directly, you either have to add the directory to PATH, or put it in a directory thats already in a path

all scripts start with a shebang to explain what interpreter to use such as #!/bin/bash

comments should be used to explain what a script should do

use read VARIABLE to read user input

use $VARIABLE to call back the variable

scripts are executed in a sub shell. if you want to run it in the current shell, use source myscript or . myscript
