different conditional statements are available
	if .. then .. fi - every if statement ends in fi
	while .. do .. done
	until .. do .. done
	case .. in .. esac
	for .. in .. do .. done

test command can return true or false based on comparisons, test can be called with either test 1 -lt 2 or [1 lt 2]

use man test to see all comparisons available



consider the following script:

if [ -z $1]
then
	echo you have to provide an argument
	exit 6
fi

echo the argument is $1


if [-z $1] - $1 is the first arg in a script. this line checks if you have provided an argument

exit 6 - exit stops the script immediately. 6 is the exit code. there are many error codes available.
