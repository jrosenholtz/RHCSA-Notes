19.4 using loops in shell scripts part 2

consider the following script:

#!/bin/bash

COUNTER=$1
COUNTER=$(( COUNTER * 60 ))

minusone(){
	COUNTER=$((COUNTER - 1))
	sleep 1
}

while [$COUNTER -gt 0 ]
do
	echo you have $COUNTER seconds left
	minusone
done

[ $COUNTER = 0] && echo time is up && minusone
[ $COUNTER '-1'] && echo you are one second late && minusone

while true
do
	echo you are now ${COUNTER#-} seconds late
	minusone
done

double braces allows you to perform arithmetic operations $(())

$$ is another way of writing if true then in a more compact way

${#-} removes the minus from the - number
