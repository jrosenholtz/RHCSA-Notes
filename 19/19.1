19.1 Understanding Bash Shell Scripts

a shell script can be as simple as a number of commands that is sequentially executed

scripts normally work with variables to make them react differently in different environments

conditional statemtents such as if, for, case, and while can be used

these can be used to optimize an IT environment, but there are other options such as python and ansible

shell scripts are common as they are easy to learn and implement

a shell will always be available to interpret code, no interpreters are required I.E python

even on the smallest linux systems will have a shell

if the scripts use internal commands only, they are very fast

there is no need to compile anything

there are no modules used in bash, this makes them rather static

bash shell scripts are not idempotent, if you ru8n the same script more then once, you may not always get the same result with bash shell scripts
