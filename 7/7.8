7.8 Understanding ACL

an acl is used to grant permissions to additional users and groups

the normal ACL applies to existing files only. If you apply an ACL to a directory it will work on currently existing files, but not new ones.

use a default acl on a directory to apply it to new files also

getfacl shows current settings

setfacl -R -m g:somegroup:rx /data/groups
	-R is recursive
	-m is modify
	-rx is the permissions read and execute
	-/data/groups is the directory to apply permissions
	
setfacl -m d:g:somegroup:rx /data/groups
	this is the same but sets it as default with the d: tag
	this is automatically recursive when set on a directory
