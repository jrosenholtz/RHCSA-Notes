7.6 Managing special permissions

SUID
	chmod 4770 myfile
	chmod u+s myfile
	
SUID allows a user to run a file as the OWNER of the file. For example, if the owner of a file with suid is root, a user will be able to run it as root even without sudo permissions

Usually you wouldn't want this. 

SGID
	chmod 2770 myfile
	chmod g+s myfile
	
this on the other hand is very useful, especially for shared group folders

sticky bit
	chmod 1770 mydir
	chmod +t mydir

this can be useful to prevent users from deleting files thye dont own
