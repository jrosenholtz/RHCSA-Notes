14.8 Mounting partitions through /etc/fstab

/etc/fstab is the main config file to persistently mount partitions

/etc/fstab content is used to generate systemd mounts by the systemd-fstab-generator utility

to update systemd, make sure to use systemctl daemon-reload after editing /etc/fstab

the first line contains the name of the device you want to be mounted

the second line is the mount target

the third line is the file system type

the fourth line is defaults for default mount options

the last lines are 0 0. These are both legacy options that no longer matter


make sure the target directories are created and use mount -a to mount
