14.3 Understanding GPT and MBR partitions

master boot record (MBR) is part of the 1981 PC spec
	512 bytes to store boot info
	64 bytes to store partitions
	place for 4 partitions only with a max size of 2 tb
	to use more partitions, extended and logical partitions must be used
	
GUID Partition table is a newer partition table (2010)
	in guid, there is more space to store partitions
	used to overcome MBR limitations
	128 partitions max
	there is no more need for extended and logical partitions
	
you may encounter both partition types, so you need to be familiar with each
