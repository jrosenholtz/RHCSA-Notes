14.2 understanding linux storage options

partitions are the classical solution and used in all cases
	paritions can be used to allocated dedicated storage to specific types of data. 
	as an example, you can put the /home directory on a different position. This way, users will not be able to fill up the OS directories. 
	
LVM logical volumes. 
	these are used at the default RHEL installation
	this adds flexibility to storage, allowing resizing, snapshots, and other useful abilities
	
stratis
	this is a next generation volume managing filesystem that uses thin provisioning by default. 
	implemented in user space, which makes API access possible
	this means it can be addressed from different applications, making it useful for environments which use cloud or virtualization. 
	
Virtual Data Optimizer (VDO)
	VDO is focused on sotring files in the most efficient way
	managed deduplicated and compressed storage pools
