14.4 Creating partitions with parted

while creating partitions, you do NOT automatically create a file system. 

the parted file system attribute only writes unimportant file system metadata

in RHEL 8, parted is the default utility

you can also use fdisk for MBR and gdisk for GUID  partitions

here is the process:

use parted followed by the name of the device you want to work only

parted /dev/sdb

use print to show if there is a current partition table

print

use mklablel to set a partition scheme. use mbr or gpt

mklabel gpt

next use mkpart part-type name fs-type start end
	part-type: applies to MBR only, this sets a primary, logical, or extended partition.
	name: arbitrary name required for GPT
	fs-type: this does NOT modify the file system, but instead sets irrelevant file system dependent metadata
	start end: specify start and end, counting from the beginning of the disk.
	ex: mkpart primary 1024MiB 2048 MiB
	
	note the little i in MiB, this works with 1024 instead of 1000 as MIB would
	

use print to verify creation of the partition

quit to texit the parted shell

udevadm settle to ensure that the new partition device is created. It makes sure all device names are updated 

you can use cat /proc/partitions to verify the creation of the partition
